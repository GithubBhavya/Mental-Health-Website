                <h2>College Stress</h2>
                <p>
                    Stress is just one of the many hurdles college students face. Short-term stress can help learners raise a grade,
                    polish an essay, or pursue a coveted career opportunity. But long-term stress, if left unaddressed, can have
                    detrimental side effects.According to the American Institute of Stress, 4 in 5 college students experience frequent
                    stress. Unchecked stress can lead to physical side effects like trouble concentrating, irritability, a lack of
                    energy, appetite changes, a weakened immune system, and trouble sleeping.In addition to the negative side effects
                    stress brings, more college students than ever report feeling it for extended periods. Although the majority of
                    this stress often stems from coursework, other factors, such as family, friends, and work, can increase stress
                    and contribute to undesirable academic and personal outcomes.

                    Small amounts of stress for short periods of time can be healthy, as good stress can help us motivate ourselves to
                    prepare for exams or make positive changes in our lives. However, stress becomes harmful when it occurs for too
                    long or is chronic—when our bodies don’t have a clear indication of when to return to normal functioning. Chronic
                    high stress has several negative affects on our bodies and brains

                    Why we travel may differ from one person to another, but people traveling always develop empathy and a deeper
                    understanding of other cultures. Being more understanding and tolerant about a culture different than ours is part
                    of being smarter, but I consider it as a benefits of traveling in itself.

                    Physiological effects, similar to those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobias.In adults,
                    it may cause tears as well as excessive sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations as
                    a result of the fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they
                    walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly
                    exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia.[12] These visible symptoms further reinforce the
                    anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part
                    of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening
                    situations. They found that patients with more severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased
                    response in their amygdalae.[18] People with SAD may avoid looking at other people, and even their surroundings,
                    to a greater extent than their peers, possibly to decrease the risk of eye contact, which can be interpreted as
                    a nonverbal signal of openness to social interaction
