                <h2>Social Anxiety</h2>
                <p>
                    Social anxiety disorder, sometimes referred to as social phobia, is a type of anxiety disorder that
                    causes extreme fear in social settings. People with this disorder have trouble talking to people,
                    meeting new people, and attending social gatherings. They fear being judged or scrutinized by others
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Intense fear of interacting or talking with strangers. Fear that others will notice that you look anxious.
                    Fear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or
                    having a shaky voice. Avoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Physical symptoms often include excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea.
                    Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort.
                    Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common
                    for sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated,
                    or both; this can lead to alcohol use disorder, eating disorders or other kinds of substance use disorders.                    SAD is sometimes referred to as an illness of lost opportunities where "individuals make major life choices
                    to accommodate their illness". According to ICD-10 guidelines, the main diagnostic criteria of social
                    phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of behaving in a way that will be embarrassing or
                    humiliating, avoidance and anxiety symptoms.[5] Standardized rating scales can be used to screen for social
                    anxiety disorder and measure the severity of anxiety.

                    Physiological effects, similar to those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobias.In adults,
                    it may cause tears as well as excessive sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations as
                    a result of the fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they
                    walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly
                    exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia.[12] These visible symptoms further reinforce the
                    anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part
                    of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening
                    situations. They found that patients with more severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased
                    response in their amygdalae.[18] People with SAD may avoid looking at other people, and even their surroundings,
                    to a greater extent than their peers, possibly to decrease the risk of eye contact, which can be interpreted as
                    a nonverbal signal of openness to social interaction
