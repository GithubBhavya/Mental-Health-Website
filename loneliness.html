                <h2>Loneliness</h2>
                <p>
                    Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to each individual. Because it has no single
                    common cause, the prevention and treatment of this potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically.For
                    example, a lonely child who struggles to make friends at school has different needs than a lonely older adult
                    whose spouse has recently died.This article discusses what we mean by the term "lonely," as well as the various
                    causes, health consequences, symptoms, and potential treatments for loneliness.

                    While common definitions of loneliness describe it as a state of solitude or being alone, loneliness is actually a
                    state of mind. Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. People who are lonely often crave human
                    contact, but their state of mind makes it more difficult to form connections with other people. Researchers suggest
                    that loneliness is associated with social isolation, poor social skills, introversion, and depression.

                    Why we travel may differ from one person to another, but people traveling always develop empathy and a deeper
                    understanding of other cultures. Being more understanding and tolerant about a culture different than ours is part
                    of being smarter, but I consider it as a benefits of traveling in itself.

                    Loneliness, according to many experts, is not necessarily about being alone. Instead, if you feel alone and isolated,
                    then that is how loneliness plays into your state of mind. For example, a college freshman might feel lonely despite
                    being surrounded by roommates and other peers. A soldier beginning their military career might feel lonely after
                    being deployed to a foreign country, despite being constantly surrounded by other troop members.Additionally, it can be
                    a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression. Depression often causes people to withdrawal socially, which
                    can lead to isolation. Research also suggests that loneliness can be a factor that contributes to symptoms of
                    depression
