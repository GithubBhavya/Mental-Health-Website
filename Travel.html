                    The benefits of traveling are not just a one-time thing: traveling changes you physically and psychologically.
                    Having little time or money isn't a valid excuse. You can fly for cheap very easily. If you have a full-time
                    job and a family, you can still travel on the weekends or holidays, even with a baby.2020 has been a tough year
                    for travel - to say the least. But don't let that discourage you from making travel plans in 2021!Here are some
                    of the main benefits of traveling, in case you need convincing. And I'm sure that once you get started, you'll
                    find some more yourself!
                </p>

                    From cutting down on stress, to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease, the health benefits of Traveling
                    are huge.You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: including some walking to your trip is
                    sure to make your body feel better. For some people, wandering abroad is even a cure for depression and anxiety.
                    Of course, it's not a foolproof cure, but it might help you feel better, both physically and psychologically.
                    Traveling more is likely to have a tremendous impact on your mental well-being, especially if you're no used to
                    going out of your comfort zone.Trust me: travel more and your doctor will be happy. Be sure to get in touch with
                    your physician, they might recommend some medication to accompany you in your travels, especially if you're heading
                    to regions of the globe with potentially dangerous diseases.

                    Why we travel may differ from one person to another, but people traveling always develop empathy and a deeper
                    understanding of other cultures. Being more understanding and tolerant about a culture different than ours is part
                    of being smarter, but I consider it as a benefits of traveling in itself.

                    Physiological effects, similar to those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobias.In adults,
                    it may cause tears as well as excessive sweating, nausea, difficulty breathing, shaking, and palpitations as
                    a result of the fight-or-flight response. The walk disturbance (where a person is so worried about how they
                    walk that they may lose balance) may appear, especially when passing a group of people. Blushing is commonly
                    exhibited by individuals suffering from social phobia.[12] These visible symptoms further reinforce the
                    anxiety in the presence of others. A 2006 study found that the area of the brain called the amygdala, part
                    of the limbic system, is hyperactive when patients are shown threatening faces or confronted with frightening
                    situations. They found that patients with more severe social phobia showed a correlation with increased
                    response in their amygdalae.[18] People with SAD may avoid looking at other people, and even their surroundings,
                    to a greater extent than their peers, possibly to decrease the risk of eye contact, which can be interpreted as
                    a nonverbal signal of openness to social interaction
