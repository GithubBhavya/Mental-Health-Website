                <h2>How to Feel Good about Yourself?</h2>
                <p>
                    Some days are better than others. On those days that go less well, we usually end up being hard on ourselves.
                    Here are some tools to avoid doing so.Keep going. Don't let life's changes throw you off track, but remember that
                    most extenuating circumstances are temporary. Gain more clarity by staying the course and channeling your energy
                    in a positive direction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Trust yourself. Believe in your inner resources, no matter what, and you'll grow from the experience. I believe that
                    the answers usually lie within and you are probably smart enough to figure out what you need to do. Give yourself a
                    little time and have patience. Be friends with life. Remember that the world is not out to get you and it does not
                    punish you. You do that to yourself. Learning to focus on other opportunities or in another direction can give
                    you some perspective.Watch your thoughts. Your thinking will never be 100 percent positive. You must learn to
                    dismiss the negative thoughts and stay open to other ideas that will help you move in a positive direction.
                    Start recognizing negative thoughts and use your mind to quell them..
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Summon the strength you have inside. Learn to access and direct your strengths to the highest good for all concerned.
                    Believe that your strength and intelligence can help you deal with anything. Remember that you have survived worse.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Learn to love yourself. You do not have to be who you are today, and your life is not scripted. Changing how you feel about
                    yourself means creating a strategy, gathering some new tools, and making yourself into the person you want to be. A
                    good way to start is to stop doing things that hurt. Don't want too much. Desire can be a powerful motivating tool,
                    but wanting something too much can be very painful and very expensive, so don't live beyond your means or covet the
                    unattainable. Seek your desire, but keep your integrity.
                </p>
