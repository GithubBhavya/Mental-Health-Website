                <h2>A+ Mentality</h2>
                <p>
                    An A+ student is a dreamy title to get. Who doesnt want to be among the best students in class, never going crazy by
                    the end of the school or college year, fighting your way out of the final exams so to avoid summer classes?
                    Plus, as you know, higher grades will increase your chances to get into the best universities, which could lead to
                    a more successful career in the future. So here are ten rules that you should follow if you want to become an A+
                    student. You will see that it is much easier to make it happen than you think.

                <p>
                    The first rule that you should follow so to become an A+ student is to make the most of your classes. No matter how
                    much boring you find them, there is a reason why they exist, and it that they give you the opportunity to get to
                    know about the topic, ask questions and interact with your teacher and classmates. So make the most of it.Doing homework
                    can be an annoyance, but it is the best resource you got to stay on top of your study. It will give you the opportunity
                    to fix in your mind and revise what you have learned at school or college, and check if you have any doubts. So, even
                    if you have some time in your hands, always try to get your homework done on the same day they are assigned.

                    Taking notes is an art, but one that you have to learn by yourself. There are many techniques on how to take notes,
                    but the fact is that each person is different about it. Maybe what looks like a complete mess to someone else is a
                    perfect and efficient method for you, and this is all that matter. But you should spend some time mastering how to
                    take notes in class and during your research, plus how to index them, so you can find them when necessary.
                </p>

                    The place where you study is your sanctuary. Again, this is a particular choice. But you need to have a designed area
                    to study. It will help you to turn on the required mindset. It can be your room, the library, the kitchen table.
                    Just make sure that you have everything you need nearby, so you dont have any excuses to be wandering around the
                    place.A study plan with a calendar can be your best friend on your journey to becoming an A+ student. At the beginning
                    of each semester, you should get your syllabus, your school calendar, plus any other resources given by your school and
                    create your own schedule. It needs to compile all-important deadlines, such as your assignments and exams, so you will
                    not get caught by surprise. Has your semester already started? No problem, you still can get it done for whatever
                    weeks you are still going to attend classes.
