                <h2>Love Yourself</h2>
                <p>
                    Why is it so difficult to love ourselves? Basically, the short answer to this question is that we were raised
                    in a society that didn’t teach us about self-love. This may not seem very important to some, but self-love
                    is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Loving yourself provides you with self-confidence, self-worth,
                    and in general, you feel more positive. If you can learn to love yourself, you will feel happier and will learn
                    to take better care of yourself. Looking in the mirror, most of us see a lot of different flaws and remember
                    too many past experiences and failings to love ourselves. The less you love yourself, listen to yourself, and
                    understand yourself, the more confused, upset, and frustrated you will be in life. When you begin to love
                    yourself and continue to love yourself more and more each day, things slowly will be a little bit better in
                    every way possible.Unfortunately, self-love isn’t always easy.

                    Accepting the pain and allowing yourself to be honest with who you are is a big step to loving yourself. Forgive yourself for past actions and things you are ashamed
                    of doing.Carrying a lot of negative emotions like jealousy, disgust, and rage can have a negative impact. We need
                    to learn how to accept not only the emotions that create love, joy, and happiness but also the ones that cause fear,
                    insecurity, and anger in our lives.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While we need to learn how to acknowledge and accept the pain with the love, another step is reconciling with a
                    cold and unopened heart. Asking yourself if you fully love yourself can be very difficult because you must accept
                    your flaws and faults.Love is something we choose, the same way we choose anger, hate, or sadness. We have the
                    power to forgive someone who has hurt us in the past. We can learn to finally heal from something when we can
                    forgive. We can always choose love.Learning to love yourself leads to better self-care. Examples of this could be
                    taking a break from time to time and accepting that no one is perfect and things happen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Needless to say, it does not mean being arrogant, conceited or thinking that you are better than anyone else.
                    It means having a healthy regard for yourself knowing that you are a worthy human being.It is important to remind
                    ourselves that no one is perfect. We all have strengths and weaknesses and we certainly possess the resources to work
                    on improving ourselves.In order to appreciate yourself it is up to you to discover what makes you unique and to further
                    develop those talents. We have a responsibility to ourselves to do so. You cannot sit around and wait for approval
                    from others. Work on accepting yourself. You are the only "you" that you have. It is in your best interests to be
                    the best you can be. Until you love yourself, you will not be able to love anyone else. You can only love another to
                    the degree that you do yourself.
